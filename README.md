Google Material design SCSS
===

My experimentation with GMD standards via Compass, Susy and Compass material colors.

This project isn't ready for production yet. The following elements were partially created.

- Navbar
- Sidebar
- Cards
- List
- Buttons
- Page head
- Buttons including FAB
- Typography

Some other elements will be added in the future besides correcting some the already created elements.
In order to preview the created elements and how they were implemented visit "index.html".

All SCSS implementations are on "_general.scss", variables including colors and mesurements are on "_variables.scss".

If you want to start your own project based on this project just install <a href="http://compass-style.org/install/">compass</a>, <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">susy</a> and <a href="https://github.com/minusfive/sass-material-colors">SASS material colors</a>.
